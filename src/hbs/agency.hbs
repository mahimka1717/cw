                    <p>The clearest driver is resourcing.</p>
                    <p>94% of respondents reported constraints in this area, whether
                        as a persistent challenge or an acute one. And we know that managing resource scarcity with an
                        external commission is often internally more palatable - easier, faster and lower risk - than
                        adding permanent headcount.</p>
                    <p>But beyond capacity, the quality bar is proving difficult to meet too.</p>

                    <p>Almost 70% of respondents
                        identified content quality as a concern, with companies experiencing skills gaps in content
                        strategy and storytelling. We assume that LLMs are compensating for any gaps in writing
                        expertise, but identifying and truly understanding the hooks, evidence, and pitch that will
                        engage specific audiences is still a sought-after human talent.Â </p>
